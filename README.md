**Problem1:** Given a matrix A of `m x n` integers (non-negative) representing the predicted prices of `m` stocks for `n` days, find a single transaction (buy and sell) that gives maximum profit.

**Problem2:** Given a matrix A of `m x n` integers (non-negative) representing the predicted prices of `m` stocks for `n` days and an integer `k` (positive), and a sequence of at most `k` transactions that gives maximum profit. [Hint :- Try to solve for k = 2 first and then expand that solution.]

**Problem3 (Bonus):** Given a matrix A of `m x n` integers (non-negative) representing the predicted prices of `m` stocks for `n` days and an integer `c` (positive), and the maximum profit with no restriction on number of transactions. However, you cannot buy any stock for `c` days after selling any stock. If you sell a stock at day `i`, you are not allowed to buy any stock until day `i+c+1`.
